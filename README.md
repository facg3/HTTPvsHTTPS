# HTTPvsHTTPS

### What is http:
##### http stands for (HyperText Transfer Protocol). is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text.


### What is https:
##### https stands for (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure). A secure form of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that is used to exchange information between webpages or access information found on a webpage. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, more commonly referred to as HTTPS, encrypts data before it is sent.

### What's the difference:
##### Using HTTPS, the computers agree on a "code" between them, and then they scramble the messages using that "code" so that no one in between can read them. This keeps your information safe from hackers. With HTTPS if anyone in between the sender and the recipient could open the message, they still could not understand it. Only the sender and the recipient, who know the "code," can decipher the message.

### How does https do that:
##### HTTPS takes the well-known and understood HTTP protocol, and simply layers a SSL/TLS (hereafter referred to simply as “SSL”) encryption layer on top of it. Servers and clients still speak exactly the same HTTP to each other, but over a secure SSL connection that encrypts and decrypts their requests and responses.

### Now, what is SSL/TLS:
##### Transport Layer Security (TLS).- and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network.

### How does it work exactly:
##### The Schannel authentication protocol suite is based on public key cryptography. The Schannel suite includes Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 3.0, SSL version 2.0, and Private Communications Transport (PCT). All Schannel protocols are based on a client/server model.
